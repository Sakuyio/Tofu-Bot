# Tofu Bot
The Yang to the Ying that is [Ari Bot](https://github.com/TeraBaito/jaidens-discord-utilities).
Tofu Bot does most 'fun' stuff like trivia, music etc. while Ari does (moderation) tools, and other misc utilities. This is also my main source of copy paste code. I copy while Tera copes.

Tofu Bot 2.x makes use of Discord.JS v13, which means system requirements also changed. 
    
## Important notice
While Tofu Bot is on GitHub, it is **NOT** open source yet. It is only shared in small groups and to trusted people. But as you may be able to see, preparations for open sourcing are being made.

## Contributing
Make sure when pushing or pull requesting changes, to push them to the [development](https://github.com/MaxTechnics/Tofu-Bot/tree/development) branch. Pushing to master will likely break version bumps and will be overwritten. The master branch is only intended for releases.
