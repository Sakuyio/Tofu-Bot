# Tofu Bot
The Yang to the Ying that is [Ari Bot](https://github.com/TeraBaito/jaidens-discord-utilities).
Tofu Bot does most 'fun' stuff like trivia, music etc. while Ari does (moderation) tools, and other misc utilities. This is also my main source of copy paste code. I copy while Tera copes.

Tofu Bot 2.x makes use of Discord.JS v13, which means system requirements also changed.
