# Celebrating One Year of Tofu Bot

This is a checkout of the original v1.0 release, with the ping vulnerability patched out. That's about it.
It's a nice look back at simpler times, and holy crap bad code indeed!

This is the exact version of tofu that was running when the bot was added to the jaiden server. Outside of the ping fix, it has been untouched everywhere else. (including the bad and the ugly. Seriously don't use this)
